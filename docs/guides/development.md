# Development Setup

!!! info "Documentation Update"
    The development guide has been reorganized into smaller, focused documents for better navigation and maintainability.

This page now redirects to the new setup documentation structure. For comprehensive setup instructions, please see:

## 📚 New Setup Guides

The development documentation is now organized into specialized guides:

### Getting Started
- **[Setup Overview](setup/overview.md)** - Prerequisites, project structure, and quick start paths

### Component Setup
- **[External Services](setup/external-services.md)** - Configure Google Maps, Firebase, PostgreSQL, Redis, Weather APIs, and JWT
- **[Backend Development](setup/backend-setup.md)** - FastAPI backend environment and development
- **[Frontend Development](setup/frontend-setup.md)** - Next.js web dashboard setup
- **[Mobile Development](setup/mobile-setup.md)** - Flutter application development
- **[ML Development](setup/ml-setup.md)** - Machine learning module configuration
- **[Observability Stack](setup/observability-setup.md)** - Monitoring, logging, and tracing

## Why the Change?

The original 1460-line development.md file has been split into focused, modular guides:

✅ **Better Navigation** - Find what you need quickly  
✅ **Improved Readability** - Focused content per topic  
✅ **Easier Maintenance** - Update specific sections without affecting others  
✅ **Better SEO** - Separate pages for different topics  
✅ **Reduced Cognitive Load** - Smaller, digestible documents
